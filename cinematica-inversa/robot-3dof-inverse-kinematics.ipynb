    "The inverse kinematics can be stated as follows. Given a desired position $p$ of the tool center point at the end of the second link, determine the joint angles $\\theta_1$, $\\theta_2$ and $\\theta_3$ that achieves this position.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two steps to the solution:\n",
    "1. Determine the first joint angle $\\theta_1$. The rotation about the first, vertical axis will determine the vertical plane in which the manipulator arm will move. All rotations in the subsequent joints will just move the arm in this vertical plane. Thus, we can find the angle $\\theta_1$ by considering the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the point $p$.\n",
    "$$ \\theta_1 = atan2(p_y, p_x), $$\n",
    "where the $atan2$ function is the inverste tangent function that keeps track of the quadrant of the angle.\n",
    "2. In the vertical plane in which the arm is now constrained, the inverse kinematics problem is a geometric problem in the plane. Consider the below figure.\n",

    "$$ \\psi = atan2(p_z, d_1) $$, \n",
